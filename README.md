# Predictive-Maintenance

Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict potential equipment failures before they occur, enabling timely maintenance and reducing downtime. By analyzing historical sensor data, the model identifies patterns and provides actionable insights to optimize maintenance schedules and improve operational efficiency.

Features
	•	Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw sensor data for modeling.
	•	Feature Engineering: Extracting key features like temperature, vibration levels, and pressure trends.
	•	Predictive Modeling: Implemented supervised machine learning models to classify failure events and predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL).
	•	Evaluation Metrics: Used accuracy, precision, recall and RMSE to validate model performance.
	•	Visualization: Interactive dashboards to display predictive insights and maintenance recommendations.
